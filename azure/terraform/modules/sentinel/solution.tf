# # further commands needed
# Install-Module AzSentinel -Scope CurrentUser -Force

# The Sentinel module uses the same Azure AD token as AzConnect so can logon using a service principal 
# as such as you use with Terraform using the following command:
# Connect-AzAccount -Credential $Credential -Tenant "xxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx" -ServicePrincipal

# After you have authentiated you can use the commands as documented here to do import of 
# hunting/alert rules â€“> https://github.com/wortell/AZSentinel/tree/master/docs

# Import-AzSentinelAlertRule -WorkspaceName la-opf-utv-weutest -SettingsFile C:\alertsrule.json

# This is an example of implemented Sentinel Analytics/Alert rules. 
# You can also import multiple JSON rules using the following

# Get-Item .\examples\*.json | Import-AzSentinelAlertRule -WorkspaceName
